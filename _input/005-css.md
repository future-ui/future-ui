We can not talk about Future UI without talking about the leaps the
CSS world has been taking lately.

## Cascading Out of Control

One of the biggest sources of complexity in large CSS codebases is the
cascade. To that end, we should eliminate it. This means only styling
classes, not tags or IDs.

## Naming Things

CSS has a single namespace. This leads to a large amount of time spent
focusing on just naming classes. BEM, OOCSS and SUITCSS are approaches
that have been developed to solve this problem but we can do
better. We can eliminate namespace conflicts with `css-modules`.

### css-modules

or when encapsulating something like `<Markdown/>` using highlight.js
which requires global classes.
