# What is this book?

This book will help you explore the state of cutting edge UI/UX
development. We will focus on React, Webpack, both Flux and
"Flux-inspired" architectures, Routing and Universal Applications.

## Tools

The TC39 categorises proposals into 4 stages:

* Stage 0 - Strawman
* Stage 1 - Proposal
* Stage 2 - Draft
* Stage 3 - Candidate
* Stage 4 - Finished

All of the code in this book is written using a stage 0 babel
transpiler. This means we have access to future ECMAScript features
all the way up to the Strawman stage (currently considered "ES7"). We
do this because this is a book about writing UI in the future and to
explore that, we will use what the cutting edge looks like today as
our starting point.

## Code examples

The simple code examples often use @gaearon's
[react-transform-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate)
which provides a simple base to jump in and explore example code.
